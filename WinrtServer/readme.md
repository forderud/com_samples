# WinrtServer

This project demonstrates how to get started authoring Windows Runtime 
classes directly with standard C++, using the C++/WinRT SDK component 
to generate implementation headers from interface (IDL) files. It also
shows how to generate C++ interop headers to allow consuming the 
component from a plain C++ project.
